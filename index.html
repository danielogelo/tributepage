        Dr. José Protacio Rizal (1861–1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer, physician, and 
        revolutionary whose works sparked the Filipino movement for independence from Spain. 
        He authored influential novels such as <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and 
        <em>El Filibusterismo</em>, which exposed social injustices and inspired 
        generations of Filipinos to fight for freedom. Even in his final moments, 
        Rizal advocated peaceful reform and the empowerment of his people through 
        education, unity, and moral courage.
